ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sana Sameer! With over 4.6 years of experience in both automation and manual testing, I am passionate about delivering high-quality software solutions. I specialize in Selenium with Java and C#, and Iâ€™m proficient in Cypress, Playwright, and Cucumber ðŸ¥’, which I use to implement Behavior Driven Development (BDD) for effective collaboration between teams.I thrive on integrating testing frameworks with CI/CD tools like Jenkins ðŸ”§ to streamline the development process. Always eager to expand my skill set, I take the opportunity to learn new tools and technologies whenever I can. I believe that continuous learning and adaptation are key to success in the ever-evolving tech landscape ðŸ“ˆ.
